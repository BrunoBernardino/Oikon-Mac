# Oikon Mac

This is the code for the Oikon OS X app, available at https://itunes.apple.com/pt/app/oikon-simple-expense-tracking/id1017838459

It's open for everyone to contribute to.

This was my first ever OS X project, and Swift experience as well, so I know the structure is not great.

If there are suggestions, I'd appreciate them!
